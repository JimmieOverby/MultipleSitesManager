MultipleSitesManager
====================

 Sitecore provides a possibility to add and configure multiple sites from inside the client without editing the web.config file. The Multiple Sites Manager module puts such possibility into practice. A user can easily manage and add custom sites.  The Multiple Sites Manager allows setting up several different sites in a single installation, but as of now also limits it to a single server.
